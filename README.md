#Project Title:

Combination of Biplot and K-Medoids Clustering Analysis Using Square Euclidean and Mahalanobis Distance (Study on Food Security Cases in East Nusa Tenggara)

#Abstract:

Multivariate analysis is analysis that has the aim of analyzing data that has several variables simultaneously. Biplot analysis is a multivariate method used to describe or map objects and variables on a two-dimensional graph. However, biplot analysis does not show detailed grouping of objects and variables so a grouping method based on similarity of characteristics is needed. K-medoids cluster analysis is a grouping method that makes data the center of a cluster. The distances used in this analysis are square euclidean and mahalanobis. This research aims to group and map the characteristics of the results of the grouping of districts/cities in East Nusa Tenggara based on the relative condition of food security according to the Food Security Agency. Determination of the number of clusters is based on relative conditions according to the Food Security Agency, namely 6 clusters. Based on clustering using k-medoids, the validity of the cluster using the silhouette index produces an average index of 0.3676 at square euclidean distance and 0.2867 at mahalanobis distance. Based on the results of the biplot analysis at both distances, cluster 1 and cluster 3 have a high number of stunted toddlers and households without access to electricity, cluster 2 has a low number of health workers, cluster 6 has low net production with high consumption, cluster 4 has no advantage, and cluster 5 at both distances has a different advantage.

#Conclusion
1. The k-medoids cluster analysis using squared Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance each resulted in 6 clusters. The validity of the clusters, measured by the silhouette index, showed an average index of 0.3676 for squared Euclidean distance and 0.2867 for Mahalanobis distance, indicating that clustering using squared Euclidean distance produced better results.

2. For both distance measures, clusters 1 and 3 have high numbers of stunted children and households without access to electricity, while cluster 2 is characterized by a low number of healthcare workers. Cluster 4 does not exhibit any distinctive advantages in any variable, and cluster 6 has low net production combined with high consumption. Additionally, in squared Euclidean distance, cluster 5 has a high number of households without access to electricity, whereas in Mahalanobis distance, it is characterized by a low number of healthcare workers.
